# Delhivery Logistics Data Analysis

This project focuses on data analysis and feature engineering for a logistics dataset from Delhivery, involving cleaning, aggregation, visualization, and modeling tasks.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas==1.3.0
- numpy==1.21.0
- scikit-learn==0.24.2
- matplotlib==3.4.2

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nishika2900/Delhivery-Case-Study.git
   cd project
   ```

2. Run the `requirements.py` script to generate `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   python requirements.py
   ```

3. Run the main analysis script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file includes patterns to ignore files and directories generated by Python, such as:
- Virtual environments (e.g., `venv`, `env/`)
- Compiled Python files (e.g., `*.pyc`)
- Temporary files (e.g., `*.tmp`)
